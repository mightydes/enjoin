## Introduction

Enjoin is an active-record ORM for PHP.
Enjoin built on [Laravel Components](https://github.com/illuminate) and inspired by [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) for Node.js.
It supports MySQL and PostgreSQL dialects.
Unlike Eloquent, Enjoin features eager loading, built-in validation and more.
